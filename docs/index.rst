Welcome to ArduinoBootloader's documentation!
==========================================
This module encapsulates access for the Arduino bootloader that uses a serial port to connect. It supports the protocols Stk500-v1 and Stk500-v2 for Atmel AVR8 CPUs.

ArduinoBootloader is Open Source software. I have `licensed <https://github.com/jjsch-dev/PyArduinoFlash/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ the code base as MIT, which provides almost no restrictions on the use of the code.
